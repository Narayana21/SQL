--PRACTICE 7

--The HR department needs a query that prompts the user for an employee last name. The query 
--then displays the last name and hire date of any employee in the same department as the 
--employee whose name they supply (excluding that employee). For example, if the user enters 
--Zlotkey, find all employees who work with Zlotkey (excluding Zlotkey)

select last_name,hire_date from employees where department_id = 
(select department_id from employees where last_name='&name')
and last_name!='&name';

--Create a report that displays the employee number, last name, and salary of all employees who 
--earn more than the average salary. Sort the results in order of ascending salary.

select employee_id,last_name,salary from employees where salary > (select avg(salary) from employees) order by salary;

--Write a query that displays the employee number and last name of all employees who work in a 
--department with any employee whose last name contains the letter “u.” Save your SQL 
--statement as lab_07_03.sql. Run your query.

select employee_id,last_name from employees where department_id in (select department_id from employees where last_name like '%u%');

--The HR department needs a report that displays the last name, department number, and job ID 
--of all employees whose department location ID is 1700.

select last_name,department_id,job_id from employees where department_id in
(select  department_id from departments where location_id=1700);

--Modify the query so that the user is prompted for a location ID.

select last_name,department_id,job_id from employees where department_id in
(select  department_id from departments where location_id=&location_id);


--Create a report for HR that displays the last name and salary of every employee who reports to 
--King

select manager_id from employees where last_name ='King';

select last_name ,salary from employees where manager_id in
(select employee_id from employees where last_name='King');

--Create a report for HR that displays the department number, last name, and job ID for every 
--employee in the Executive department

select * from departments;

select department_id,last_name,job_id from employees where department_id = 
(select department_id from departments where department_name='Executive');


--Modify the query in lab_07_03.sql to display the employee number, last name, and salary 
--of all employees who earn more than the average salary, and who work in a department with 
--any employee whose last name contains a “u.” Resave lab_07_03.sql as 
--lab_07_07.sql. Run the statement in lab_07_07.sql

select employee_id,last_name,salary from employees
where department_id in 
(select department_id from employees where last_name like '%u%') and salary>(select avg(salary) from employees );

select employee_id, last_name, salary
from employees
where salary > (select avg(salary) from employees) and
department_id in (select department_id from employees where last_name like '%u%');
